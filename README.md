# Arcane Templates

Complete Flutter project templates using the Arcane UI framework - Material Design-free UI with pure Arcane components.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Use the interactive setup wizard to create your complete project in minutes:**

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The wizard handles everything automatically:
- ✅ CLI tools verification
- 🏗️ 3-project architecture creation (client, models, server)
- 📦 Automatic dependency installation
- 🔥 Optional Firebase integration

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The setup wizard creates a professional 3-project architecture:

```
your-project-root/
├── your_app/              # Main Flutter client application
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── main.dart
│   │   └── screens/
│   ├── android/
│   ├── ios/
│   ├── web/
│   ├── macos/
│   ├── linux/
│   ├── windows/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── icon/
│   └── pubspec.yaml       # With dart run scripts
│
├── your_app_models/       # Shared Dart package for data models
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── your_app_models.dart
│   │   └── models/
│   │       ├── user.dart
│   │       ├── user_settings.dart
│   │       └── server_command.dart
│   └── pubspec.yaml
│
├── your_app_server/       # Flutter server application
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── main.dart
│   │   ├── api/           # REST API endpoints
│   │   ├── service/       # Business logic
│   │   └── util/          # Authentication, helpers
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── script_deploy.sh
│   └── pubspec.yaml
│
├── config/                # Configuration files
│   ├── keys/              # Service account keys (gitignored)
│   ├── firebase.json
│   ├── firestore.rules
│   ├── firestore.indexes.json
│   └── storage.rules
│
├── firebase.json
├── .firebaserc
└── .gitignore
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ **Separation of concerns**: Client, models, and server are independent
- ✅ **Code sharing**: Models used by both client and server (type-safe)
- ✅ **Independent deployment**: Deploy client and server separately
- ✅ **Better testing**: Test each layer independently
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add microservices or additional clients

## 🔧 Dart Run Scripts

After setup, your client app includes convenient dart run scripts:

### Firebase Deployment
```bash
dart run deploy_firebase       # Deploy all Firebase services
dart run deploy_firestore      # Deploy Firestore rules only
dart run deploy_storage        # Deploy Storage rules only
dart run deploy_hosting        # Deploy to production hosting
dart run deploy_hosting_beta   # Deploy to beta hosting
```

### Web Building & Deployment
```bash
dart run build_web            # Build web release
dart run deploy_web           # Build + deploy to production
```

### Asset Generation
```bash
dart run gen_icons            # Generate app launcher icons
dart run gen_splash           # Generate splash screens
dart run gen_assets           # Generate both icons and splash
```

### Platform Setup
```bash
dart run pod_install_ios      # Clean + reinstall iOS CocoaPods
dart run pod_install_macos    # Clean + reinstall macOS CocoaPods
```

These scripts are defined in your app's `pubspec.yaml` and run from the app directory.

```

Follow the prompts:
1. Choose template (arcane_template or arcane_beamer)
2. Enter organization domain (e.g., com.mycompany)
3. Enter app name (e.g., my_awesome_app)
4. Choose Firebase integration (yes/no)
5. Choose Google Cloud Run deployment (yes/no)

The wizard creates everything automatically!

### Development

```bash
# Run your app
cd my_awesome_app
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d chrome          # Web browser
flutter run -d macos           # macOS desktop
flutter run -d linux           # Linux desktop

# Hot reload is automatic - just save your files!
```

### Generate Assets

```bash
# From your app directory
cd my_awesome_app

# Generate new icons and splash
dart run gen_assets

# Or individually
dart run gen_icons
dart run gen_splash
```

### Deploy to Firebase

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Skip Asset Generation

If you want to skip icon and splash screen generation:

```bash
# Edit generated project's pubspec.yaml to customize assets
# Then run generation manually when ready
cd my_app
dart run gen_assets
```

### Custom Platform Versions

```bash
# From project root after setup
./scripts/set_android_min_sdk.sh my_app 24
./scripts/set_ios_platform_version.sh my_app 14.0
./scripts/set_macos_platform_version.sh my_app 11.0
```

### Deploy Beta Hosting

1. Create beta site in Firebase Console:
   - Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/hosting/sites
   - Click "Add another site"
   - Enter Site ID: `your-project-id-beta`

2. Deploy:
```bash
cd my_app
dart run deploy_hosting_beta
```

### Update Firebase Rules

After modifying `config/firestore.rules` or `config/storage.rules`:

```bash
cd my_app
dart run deploy_firestore   # Update Firestore rules
dart run deploy_storage     # Update Storage rules
```

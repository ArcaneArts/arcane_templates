## Platform Overview

### Flutter with Arcane UI

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Arcane UI is a custom widget library built on Flutter that provides a consistent design system.

**Target Outputs:**
- iOS applications
- Android applications
- macOS applications
- Windows applications
- Linux applications
- Web applications (via CanvasKit or HTML renderer)

### Jaspr with Arcane Jaspr

Jaspr is a Dart web framework that renders to semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Arcane Jaspr is the web-specific implementation of the Arcane design system, providing 75+ components optimized for web.

**Target Outputs:**
- Static websites (pre-rendered HTML)
- Single-page applications (SPA)
- Server-side rendered applications
- Documentation sites
- Marketing pages

## Architecture Patterns

### Flutter + Arcane Architecture

```
my_app/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart                 # App entry point
│   ├── screens/                  # Screen widgets
│   ├── widgets/                  # Reusable widgets
│   ├── services/                 # Business logic
│   ├── models/                   # Data models
│   └── utils/                    # Utilities
├── assets/                       # Images, fonts
├── ios/                          # iOS-specific
├── android/                      # Android-specific
├── macos/                        # macOS-specific
├── windows/                      # Windows-specific
├── linux/                        # Linux-specific
├── web/                          # Web-specific
└── pubspec.yaml
```

**Key Patterns:**
- StatefulWidget for local state
- InheritedWidget/Provider for shared state
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service locator for dependency injection
- Navigator 2.0 or Beamer for routing

### Jaspr + Arcane Jaspr Architecture

```
my_web_app/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.server.dart          # Server entry (SSG/SSR)
│   ├── main.client.dart          # Client entry (hydration)
│   ├── app.dart                  # App component
│   ├── screens/                  # Page components
│   ├── components/               # Reusable components
│   ├── layouts/                  # Page layouts
│   ├── services/                 # Business logic
│   └── utils/                    # Utilities
├── content/                      # Markdown content (optional)
│   ├── docs/                     # Documentation pages
│   └── guides/                   # Guide pages

│   └── styles.css                # Global styles
└── pubspec.yaml
```

**Key Patterns:**
- StatefulComponent for local state
- ArcaneApp for theming
- Content-driven pages with jaspr_content
- ArcaneStyleData for type-safe styling
